# Smart Home Monitoring System

## Overview

The **Smart Home Monitoring System** is a mobile application developed using Flutter that leverages the device's sensors to monitor environmental conditions within a home. The application integrates three key features: light level sensing and automation, motion detection and security, and location tracking with geofencing.

## Features

### 1. Light Level Sensing and Automation
- Measures ambient light levels using the device's light sensor.
- Automates smart lights or sends notifications based on changes in light levels.

### 2. Motion Detection and Security
- Detects motion or vibrations using the device's accelerometer sensor.
- Provides a real-time display of sensor data using charts or visual indicators.
- Sends push notifications or alerts for significant motion events.

### 3. Location Tracking and Geofencing
- Monitors device movement within specified geographical boundaries (geofencing).
- Uses GPS data to trigger actions or notifications when entering or exiting predefined areas.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SethLoveByiringiro/Smart-Home-Monitoring-System.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Smart-Home-Monitoring-System
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the application on an emulator or physical device:
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

2. Follow the on-screen instructions to configure and use the features:
    - **Light Level Sensing:** Adjust smart lights or receive notifications based on ambient light levels.
    - **Motion Detection:** View real-time motion data and receive alerts for significant motion events.
    - **Location Tracking:** Monitor location and receive notifications for geofence events.

## Configuration

- Ensure that the necessary permissions for accessing sensors and GPS are granted in the device settings.
- Configure any required API keys or service credentials in the `lib/config` directory.

## Testing

- Thoroughly test the application on both Android and iOS platforms to ensure reliable sensor readings and responsive behavior.
